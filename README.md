# Our Vision 
### For educators, teachers, and game developers who need a more hands-on and interactive experience, LightMap is a robust image projection framework which allows one to be part of the image. Unlike current frameworks which rely on static objects, LightMap responds and interacts with moving subjects in real-time.
